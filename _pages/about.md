Hi~ I'm Taeha Hong, software developer in South Korea.

I'm currently interested in Blockchain especially [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network).
And I'm developing Web3.0 and my own blockchain using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), [Starport](https://starport.com/) and [cosmJs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/).

[Tokenity](http://3.35.0.252/) is a decentralized social network platform. People can post photos and articles on our platform and publish them to nft. Creators can mint and trade their coins.

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
